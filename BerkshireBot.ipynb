       "[{'text': 'BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. To the Stockholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Operating earnings in 1977 of $21,904,000, or $22.54 per share, were moderately better than anticipated a year ago. Of these earnings, $1.43 per share resulted from substantial realized capital gains by Blue Chip Stamps which, to the extent of our proportional interest in that company, are included in our operating earnings figure. Capital gains or losses realized directly by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or its insurance subsidiaries are not included in our calculation of operating earnings. While too much attention should not be paid to the figure for any single year, over the longer term the record regarding aggregate capital gains or losses obviously is of significance. Textile operations came in well below forecast, while the results of the Illinois National Bank as well as the operating earnings attributable to our equity interest in Blue Chip Stamps were about as anticipated. However, insurance operations, led again by the truly outstanding results of Phil Liesche’s managerial group at National Indemnity Company, were even better than our optimistic expectations. Most companies define “record” earnings as a new high in earnings per share. Since businesses customarily add from year to year to their equity base, we find nothing particularly noteworthy in a management performance combining, say, a 10% increase in equity capital and a 5% increase in earnings per share. After all, even a totally dormant savings account will produce steadily rising interest earnings each year because of compounding. Except for special cases (for example, companies with unusual debt-equity ratios or those with important assets carried at unrealistic balance sheet values), we believe a more appropriate measure of managerial economic performance to be return on equity capital. In 1977 our operating earnings on beginning equity capital amounted to 19%, slightly better than last year and above both our own long-term average and that of American industry in aggregate. But, while our operating earnings per share were up 37% from the year before, our beginning capital was up 24%, making the gain in earnings per share considerably less impressive than it might appear at first glance. We expect difficulty in matching our 1977 rate of return during the forthcoming year.',\n",

We expect difficulty in matching our 1977 rate of return during the forthcoming year. Beginning equity capital is up 23% from a year ago, and we expect the trend of insurance underwriting profit margins to turn down well before the end of the year. Nevertheless, we expect a reasonably good year and our present estimate, subject to the usual caveats regarding the frailties of forecasts, is that operating earnings will improve somewhat on a per share basis during 1978. Textile Operations The textile business again had a very poor year in 1977. We have mistakenly predicted better results in each of the last two years. This may say something about our forecasting abilities, the nature of the textile industry, or both. Despite strenuous efforts, problems in marketing and manufacturing have persisted. Many difficulties experienced in the marketing area are due primarily to industry conditions, but some of the problems have been of our own making. A few shareholders have questioned the wisdom of remaining in the textile business which, over the longer term, is unlikely to produce returns on capital comparable to those available in many other businesses. Our reasons are several: (1) Our mills in both New Bedford and Manchester are among the largest employers in each town, utilizing a labor force of high average age possessing relatively non-transferable skills.',\n",

Our reasons are several: (1) Our mills in both New Bedford and Manchester are among the largest employers in each town, utilizing a labor force of high average age possessing relatively non-transferable skills. Our workers and unions have exhibited unusual understanding and effort in cooperating with management to achieve a cost structure and product mix which might allow us to maintain a viable operation. (2) Management also has been energetic and straightforward in its approach to our textile problems. In particular, Ken Chace’s efforts after the change in corporate control took place in 1965 generated capital from the textile division needed to finance the acquisition and expansion of our profitable insurance operation. (3) With hard work and some imagination regarding manufacturing and marketing configurations, it seems reasonable that at least modest profits in the textile division can be achieved in the future. Insurance Underwriting Our insurance operation continued to grow significantly in 1977. It was early in 1967 that we made our entry into this industry through the purchase of National Indemnity Company and National Fire and Marine Insurance Company (sister companies) for approximately $8.6 million. In that year their premium volume amounted to $22 million. In 1977 our aggregate insurance premium volume was $151 million. No additional shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock have been issued to achieve any of this growth. Rather, this almost 600% increase has been achieved through large gains in National Indemnity’s traditional liability areas plus the starting of new companies (Cornhusker Casualty Company in 1970, Lakeland Fire and Casualty Company in 1971, Texas United Insurance Company in 1972, The Insurance Company of Iowa in 1973, and Kansas Fire and Casualty Company in late 1977), the purchase for cash of other insurance companies (Home and Automobile Insurance Company in 1971, Kerkling Reinsurance Corporation, now named Central Fire and Casualty Company, in 1976, and Cypress Insurance Company at yearend 1977), and finally through the marketing of additional products, most significantly reinsurance, within the National Indemnity Company corporate structure.',\n",

In aggregate, the insurance business has worked out very well. But it hasn’t been a one-way street. Some major mistakes have been made during the decade, both in products and personnel. We experienced significant problems from (1) a surety operation initiated in 1969, (2) the 1973 expansion of Home and Automobile’s urban auto marketing into the Miami, Florida area, (3) a still unresolved aviation “fronting” arrangement, and (4) our Worker’s Compensation operation in California, which we believe retains an interesting potential upon completion of a reorganization now in progress. It is comforting to be in a business where some mistakes can be made and yet a quite satisfactory overall performance can be achieved. In a sense, this is the opposite case from our textile business where even very good management probably can average only modest results. One of the lessons your management has learned - and, unfortunately, sometimes re-learned - is the importance of being in businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds. In 1977 the winds in insurance underwriting were squarely behind us. Very large rate increases were effected throughout the industry in 1976 to offset the disastrous underwriting results of 1974 and 1975. But, because insurance policies typically are written for one-year periods, with pricing mistakes capable of correction only upon renewal, it was 1977 before the full impact was felt upon earnings of those earlier rate increases.',\n",

But, because insurance policies typically are written for one-year periods, with pricing mistakes capable of correction only upon renewal, it was 1977 before the full impact was felt upon earnings of those earlier rate increases. The pendulum now is beginning to swing the other way. We estimate that costs involved in the insurance areas in which we operate rise at close to 1% per month. This is due to continuous monetary inflation affecting the cost of repairing humans and property, as well as “social inflation”, a broadening definition by society and juries of what is covered by insurance policies. Unless rates rise at a comparable 1% per month, underwriting profits must shrink. Recently the pace of rate increases has slowed dramatically, and it is our expectation that underwriting margins generally will be declining by the second half of the year. We must again give credit to Phil Liesche, greatly assisted by Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims, for an extraordinary underwriting achievement in National Indemnity’s traditional auto and general liability business during 1977. Large volume gains have been accompanied by excellent underwriting margins following contraction or withdrawal by many competitors in the wake of the 1974-75 crisis period. These conditions will reverse before long. In the meantime, National Indemnity’s underwriting profitability has increased dramatically and, in addition, large sums have been made available for investment. As markets loosen and rates become inadequate, we again will face the challenge of philosophically accepting reduced volume.',\n",

In the early years, I made mistakes by following a \"cigar butt\" approach to investing, which involved buying cheap stocks with the hope of selling them at a profit despite poor long-term prospects (1989). However, I realized that this strategy was not ideal and shifted to a more value-oriented approach that considers a business as a whole, emphasizing factors such as understanding the business, favorable long-term prospects, honest management, and an attractive price (1992).\n",

      "\n",
      "Warren Buffett's decision to invest in companies like Coca-Cola and Apple aligns with his long-term investment philosophy of seeking businesses with strong competitive advantages and enduring economics. In the case of Coca-Cola, Buffett's initial exposure to the company dates back to his childhood when he engaged in a small-scale distribution business with Coca-Cola products (1994). This early familiarity with the company's products and the success of its core business model likely contributed to his decision to invest in Coca-Cola later on. Similarly, Buffett's investment in American Express and other companies has been driven by his history with these firms and the long-term familiarity he has developed with their operations and products (1994).\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffett's focus on investing in companies with understandable, enduring, and mouth-watering economics is evident in his preference for businesses like Coca-Cola and Gillette, which have strong brand names, high-quality products, and robust distribution systems (1991, 1993). He emphasizes the importance of selecting businesses with competitive advantages that can withstand changes in the industry landscape over time. Buffett's approach to investing in these \"Inevitables\" and \"Highly Probables\" reflects his belief in the power of owning businesses with strong long-term growth prospects, even if it means paying a premium for quality companies (1996).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Buffett's investment strategy emphasizes the importance of maintaining focus and avoiding distractions that could lead to value stagnation or loss of competitive advantage in exceptional businesses (1996). By sticking to companies with proven track records, dominant market positions, and strong management teams, Buffett seeks to minimize the risks associated with market fluctuations or internal disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Warren Buffett's decision to invest in companies like Coca-Cola and Apple is grounded in his approach of seeking businesses with enduring competitive advantages, strong brands, and exceptional management that can generate sustained returns over the long term. His focus on long-term value creation, familiarity with the companies, and commitment to high-quality businesses align with his investment philosophy as reflected in the provided document chunks.

The company has a diverse product portfolio, strong distribution network, and a loyal customer base. Investing in Coca-Cola provides exposure to the beverage industry, which is relatively stable and resilient to economic downturns. Additionally, Coca-Cola has a history of paying dividends to its shareholders, making it an attractive option for those looking for steady income.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Apple is a leading technology company known for its innovative products, strong brand loyalty, and growing ecosystem of services. Apple has a history of generating significant profits through its popular products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers.

This approach has been consistent over the years, as outlined in the 1992 annual letter where I stated, \"We want the business to be one that we can understand; with favorable long-term prospects; operated by honest and competent people; and available at an attractive price\" (1992). \n",

In the early 2000s, I mentioned that Berkshire Hathaway did not own stocks of tech companies due to a lack of insights into which participants in the tech field possess a durable competitive advantage (1999). My team and I focus on businesses and industries unlikely to experience major change, as we seek operations that are virtually certain to possess enormous competitive strength in the long term (1996). This strategy has been successful for us as we look for businesses with demonstrated consistent earning power, good returns on equity, and little to no debt, while understanding their operations deeply (1989, 1992). We prioritize businesses with favorable long-term prospects, operated by honest and competent people, available at an attractive price, and within our circle of competence (1992, 2013).\n",

      "LLM Response: As Warren Buffett, one key takeaway from the 2019 letter on international investments is the focus on currency diversification and foreign exchange exposure. In 2006, it is mentioned that Berkshire made foreign exchange purchases to gain exposure to different currencies, taking advantage of interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and foreign countries (2006). This strategy aligns with our approach to seek currency-neutrality and utilize foreign exchange contracts as a partial offset to dollar-denominated positions (2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the letter highlights the importance of owning good businesses over cash-equivalent assets to protect against currency devaluation. Buffett emphasizes that paper money can lose value due to fiscal folly, and that fixed-coupon bonds offer no protection against runaway currency (2024). This reinforces our strategy of deploying a substantial majority of capital in equities, especially American equities with international operations, rather than cash-equivalent assets (2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the document chunks discuss the need for patience and a long-term perspective in investing. Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, emphasize the importance of being a patient investor and not succumbing to short-term market fluctuations (2022). This resonates with our approach of holding onto investments for many decades and focusing on the long-term growth potential of businesses rather than short-term market movements.\n",
